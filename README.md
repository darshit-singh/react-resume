# React Resume
## Hey there! This is my website that I made with ReactJS, hope you enjoy.
## Check out the [LIVE](https://darshit-singh.github.io/react-resume) version.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). I created this website as a fun little side project which uses a JSON file to fetch the resume information. If you wanna see how the website looks with your info, feel free to download the source code and run it locally.

## If you want to run this project locally on your machine

You can just download the code, or clone the repository. Type in:
1. `npm install` 
2. `npm start`
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
4. You can edit the JSON file inside public folder, called `resumeData.json` and that would be reflected on the site.

Thanks for checking it out :)
